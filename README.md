## Squid war

A game for squids.

### Backstory

Space Squid has stolen freshly baked cookies from the ugly Space Grandmothers. Now he must escape their wrath with his precious baked goods! Luckily, while the Space Grandmothers can throw up lasers, Space Squid knows how to shoot them out of the top of his head.

### Instructions

Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press the space bar to shoot. The shield will remain intact for 3 hits, and a cookie will fall from the sky that restores your shield health. Kill all the Grandmothers to win.

### Scoring

You can get a maximum of 150 points. For each Grandmother you kill, you get 10 points. For each shield health you lose, you lose 5 points, and the cookie power up will not restore them.
